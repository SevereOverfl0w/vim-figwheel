## Purpose

This plugin makes available the control functions defined by the [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) as vimscript functions.

This enables you to do a few things:

* Start Figwheel from vim.
    *`:FigwheelStart` will start the default cljsbuild.
    *`:FigwheelStart "dev" "devcards"` will start the cljsbuilds defined with the "dev" and "devcards" ids.
* Stop Figwheel from vim.
* Reset Figwheel from vim.
* Clean Figwheel from vim.
* Get quick access to Fighwheels status.

## Installation

Install using your favourite plugin manager,
I use [vim-plug][https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug]

```vim
Plug 'markwoodhall/vim-figwheel'
```

This plugin makes use of [vim-fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace) so you will need to install this as well.

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fireplace'

```

## Usage

The following functions are made available:

```vim
:FigwheelStart :exe s:Start(<q-args>)
:FigwheelSwitch :exe s:Switch(<q-args>)
:FigwheelClean :exe s:Clean(<q-args>)
:FigwheelBuild :exe s:Build(<q-args>)
```

```vim
:FigwheelReset :exe s:Reset()
:FigwheelStop :exe s:Stop()
:FigwheelStatus :exe s:Status()
:Figgieback :exe s:Figgieback()
```

The above functions map to the control functions defined by the Figwheel repl. You can read more [here](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

```clojure
 (stop-autobuild)            ;; stops Figwheel autobuilder
 (start-autobuild [id ...])  ;; starts autobuilder focused on optional ids
 (switch-to-build id ...)    ;; switches autobuilder to different build
 (reset-autobuild)           ;; stops, cleans, and starts autobuilder
 (build-once [id ...])       ;; builds source one time
 (clean-builds [id ..])      ;; deletes compiled cljs target files
 (fig-status)                ;; displays current state of system
 ```
