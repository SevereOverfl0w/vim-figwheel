## Purpose

This plugin makes available the control functions defined by the [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) REPL as vimscript functions.

This enables you to do a few things:

1. Start Figwheel from vim.
  * `:FigwheelStart` will start the default cljsbuild.
  * `:FigwheelStart "dev" "devcards"` will start the cljsbuilds defined with the "dev" and "devcards" ids.
2. Stop Figwheel from vim.
3. Reset Figwheel from vim.
4. Clean Figwheel from vim.
5. Get quick access to Fighwheels status.

## Installation

Install using your favourite plugin manager,
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'markwoodhall/vim-figwheel'
```

This plugin makes use of [vim-fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace) so you will need to install this as well.

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fireplace'

```

## Usage

The following functions are made available:

```vim
:FigwheelStart " Starts the default Figwheel build or an optional list of builds
:FigwheelSwitch " Switch to a Figwheel build
:FigwheelClean " Deletes compiled cljs target files for the specfied builds
:FigwheelBuild " Builds a fighweel build once
```

```vim
:FigwheelReset " Stops, cleans and starts Figwheel autobuild
:FigwheelStop  " Stops Figwheel autobuild
:FigwheelStatus " Gets the current state of Figwheel
:Figgieback " Piggiebacks onto the Fighweel browser REPL
```

The above functions map to the control functions defined by the Figwheel repl. You can read more [here](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

```clojure
 (stop-autobuild)            ;; stops Figwheel autobuilder
 (start-autobuild [id ...])  ;; starts autobuilder focused on optional ids
 (switch-to-build id ...)    ;; switches autobuilder to different build
 (reset-autobuild)           ;; stops, cleans, and starts autobuilder
 (build-once [id ...])       ;; builds source one time
 (clean-builds [id ..])      ;; deletes compiled cljs target files
 (fig-status)                ;; displays current state of system
 ```
